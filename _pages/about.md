I am a first year postgraduate student at the University of Ghent, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. I was an exchange student at the Groningen University (2022-2023) for Neurolinguistics as a student in the EMJD Program.

I am most interested in communication dynamics in adverse situations as well as in different relaxed-ecological settings. Other than this, the Neurobiology of Language is a major area of my main research.

To this end, I have employed three different approaches.

[1] Compare the different communicative behaviors of language use in Virtual Reality vs Naturalistic-Setting in dyadic conversations that of humans.

[2] Identify the causal mechanism of morphosyntax in the underlying problem-solving /   communicative strategies.

[3] Compare the recordings of crosslinguistic backgrounds in psycholinguistic research.

I believe clarifying the detailed language exchanges inside virtual reality and aligning them with physical setting-based recordings will help us identify a more detailed modulation of language use in social interactions.

Targeting language profiles of adult language learners from bi-/multi-lingual backgrounds, my project ideas explore several linguistic-cognitive areas such as spatial language, humor comprehension, co-operation, and feedback recognition in the context of Virtual Reality.
