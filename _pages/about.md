I am a second year postgraduate student at the University of Ghent, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. I was an exchange student at the Groningen University (2022-2023) as a student in the EMJD Program.

I am most interested in communication dynamics in adverse situations as well as different ecological settings. Other than this, Neurobiology of language is a part of my main research.

Till this end, I have employed three different approaches.

[1] Compare the different linguistic behaviors of language use in Virtual Reality vs physical-setting in dyadic conversations that of humans.

[2] Identify the causal mechanism of morphosyntax in the underlying problem-solving /communicative strategies.

[3] Compare the recordings of crosslinguistic backgrounds in psycholinguistic research.

I believe clarifying the detailed language exchnages inside virtual reality and aligning them with physical setting-based recordings will help us identify a more detailed modulation of language use in social interactions.
