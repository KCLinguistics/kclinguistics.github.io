Hello there! I am a gradaute student from the University of Verona, Faculty of Culture and Civilisations.

I am most interested in communication dynamics in adverse situations as well as in different relaxed-ecological settings. Other than this, I pick Neurobiology of Language in the unproductive nights for the areas in Evolutionary Linguistics, Language Anthropology, and Primate Communications - readings I do not get to do for reasons of limted room in professional schedule.


To this end, I have employed three different approaches.

[1] Compare the different communicative behaviors of language use in Virtual Reality vs Naturalistic-Setting in dyadic conversations that of humans.

[2] Identify the causal mechanism of morphosyntax in the underlying problem-solving /   communicative strategies.

[3] Compare the recordings of crosslinguistic backgrounds in psycholinguistic research.

I believe clarifying the detailed language exchanges inside virtual reality and aligning them with physical setting-based recordings will help us identify a more detailed modulation of language use in social interactions.

Targeting language profiles of adult language learners from bi-/multi-lingual backgrounds, my project ideas explore several linguistic-cognitive areas such as spatial language, humor comprehension, co-operation, and feedback recognition in the context of Virtual Reality.

If you are currently working within the areas of Virtual Reality for Humanities, Spatial Language Cognition, Multimodality, Punctuation and Grapheme Studies, feel free to contact me about your project ideas at kc[dot]linguistics@gmail[dot]com
